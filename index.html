		<h2>About Me</h2>

		<P> VCD major with a BA in Marketing. I like to create new worlds through art and writing. I love comic books and hope to be a super hero when I grow up.

		I'm originally from Indiana and was brought to Spokane during my time in the United States Navy. My wife and I decided to stay after I separated for my children, who both attend high school here.   </P>
